There’s no substitute for the experience of working with a live client - real schedules, real feedback, real politics, real changes, etc.…

## 1. STUDENT PRESENTATION

In order to present the work to clients students are forced to put words to the work that they have done in a way that allows an outside audience to understand whats being shown.

## 2. CLIENT RESPONSE

Instant feedback, both through body language and verbal response, exposes students to authentic critique which will allow them to deliver a stronger second round of designs.
This interaction also “ups the ante” for students and creates a motivation for delivering appropriate solutions for their specific audience.

## 3. PROFESSOR INPUT

At the end of the meeting the professor takes the opportunity to add in anything that the student may have missed. This serves as instant feedback for the student on then quality of their presentation and creates the feeling of presenting as a team rather than the student feeling like the success of failure of the presentation rests only on them.
