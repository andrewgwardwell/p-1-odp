# The Principles

The following principles drive our curriculum and course design at Olin. These principles are based in the literature on teaching and learning, and represent evidence-based, effective pedagogical practices to support student learning and motivation. As you will see in the videos, these principles can be enacted in multiple ways, depending on the classroom context, composition, and content of the course.
