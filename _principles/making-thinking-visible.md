title: Making Thinking Visible
color: red

Thinking happens mostly in our heads, invisible to others and even to ourselves. Learning happens through thinking, and learning increases when students externalize their thinking through problems, concepts, and questions. When students make their thinking visible to others, such as through speaking, writing, drawing, or demonstrating, they can see their own thinking progress, get timely feedback, question and discuss their ideas with others, and document their thinking for reflection.
