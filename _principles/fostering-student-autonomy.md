title: Fostering Student Autonomy
color: green
summary: Autonomous learning is the feeling that one is in control of and responsible for their own learning and success – both in terms of what they learn and how they learn. When teachers provide opportunities for students to learn autonomously, such as through supporting students with making decisions about their own learning and charting their own learning path, students become more independent, self-directed learners. Students who feel more autonomous in their learning have higher motivation to learn, are better able to self-monitor their own learning, are more aware of their own progress, have higher self-efficacy,and find value in their learning.

>Student development of self-directed learning skills is critical for success in today’s rapidly-changing engineering world. The details of how instructors may best foster engagement in life-long learning, however, are unclear; many educators have struggled to define, implement, and assess lifelong learning in engineering curricula.
