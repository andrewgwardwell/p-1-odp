color: blue

Making connections between concepts across disciplines and applying knowledge across disciplines deepens studentsâ€™ learning and their ability to transfer their knowledge and skills across contexts. Real world problems are rarely solved through a narrow, single disciplinary focus. Learning opportunities that integrate skills, concepts, and values across disciplines are more authentic and meaningful, and motivate students to think deeply, apply their learning, and develop transferable skills.
