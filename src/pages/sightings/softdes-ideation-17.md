## 1. IDEATION

This is a standard Design Thinking ideation exercise.

## 2. PEER LEARNING

In addition to facilitating the mechanics of the ideation activity, the teaching assistant is telling the students about projects from her year and other years that she's instructed, and advising them about directions they could pursue, pitfalls, and reasonable project scope.

## 3. MUSIC

A sound track was playing during the overall activity. For timed activities, students were told that they had until the end of the current song. This made the time-boxing more fun, and also meant that they could sort of sense how much time was left but there wasn't a clock to watch.

## 4. CO-TEACHING

This use of music was a technique I learned from co-teaching a previous course with Jeff, at the Library. This illustrates a kind of meta-element: that being on multiple teaching teams, where things are shuffled, is a way that instructors can to learn the elements themselves.
