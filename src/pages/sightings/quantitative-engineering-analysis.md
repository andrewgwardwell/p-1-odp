Studentsâ€™ connections to a project topic can have a significant impact on their intrinsic motivation to not only meet the expectations of the project, but also exceed those expectations.

## 1. START SMALL

Rather than jump right into making a full proposal, the students brainstormed possible users for their motion project. Who might be positively impacted by your design and analysis?

## 2. INVOLVE STUDENTS IN IDEATION & SELECTION

Having students take time in class to generate possible ideas allowed the students to think of several different project proposals they might be interested in working on. In addition, they had an opportunity to see a complete proposal of multiple ideas. This opportunity scaffolded how they might generate a project idea with their partner in the future.

## 3. PROVIDE INPUT TO SCOPE AND/OR SHAPE IDEAS

During this iterative in-class activity, we, the instructional team, were able to speak with individual students about their interests. These conversations allowed us to: (1) help them scope their ideas so that they might be feasible in the project timeline and/or (2) help them consider how they could shape an idea such that it was better connect to the material or provide a bigger impact on a user group.
